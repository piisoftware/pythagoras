      <h2 class="title">Surviving the Robot Apocalypse</h2>
      <p>
        Like troubadours of old, Pythagoras of Cascadia, in his one-man show
        “Surviving the Robot Apocalypse,” combines storytelling and song to
        contemplate moments in history when the world seemed to end, what people did
        about it, and how we might come together again today to do the same.
        Pythagoras roams from Greece to Venice to Manchester, from the tenth century
        BC to the present day, from math to looms to canals. He considers his namesake
        and what happens when a cult leader responds to irrational numbers with murder.
        He combines left-brain skills with right-brain sensibilities, numbers with
        conversations, non-profit work with three decades of experience as a software
        engineer, all supplemented with — and accompanied by — his prolific and
        prodigious work as a singer/songwriter. His stories are woven through with
        original music and reimagined covers, which he not only performs himself but
        invites his audience to perform as well. Pythagoras of Cascadia aims to heal the
        world — or at least survive the robots — by joining with others to gather in
        person, sing together, and tell stories about all we share, that which unites
        rather than divides or tears apart, how we’ve overcome before and therefore
        might again, if only we joyfully listen.
